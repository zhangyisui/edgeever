# Cloudflare Manual Deployment Guide

If you are comfortable with Cloudflare and the command line, or prefer customized control over the deployment process, follow this guide for manual deployment and future updates.

> 💡 **Tip**: If you are deploying using an AI assistant (such as Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, Cursor, or Trae), the agent should follow the [AI Agent Cloudflare Deployment](https://github.com/tianma-if/edgeever/blob/main/docs/agent-deploy-cloudflare.md) runbook.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Fork the official repository**:
   Visit and fork the official repository: [https://github.com/tianma-if/edgeever](https://github.com/tianma-if/edgeever)

2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```sh
   git clone <your fork repository URL>
   cd edgeever
   ```

3. **Deploy with the automated helper commands**:
   ```sh
   # Copy the configuration template
   cp .env.local.example .env.local

   # Install dependencies
   bun install

   # Initialize deployment resources and set the first login password
   EDGE_EVER_PASSWORD='<your password>' bun run deploy:setup

   # Check the deployment environment and configurations
   bun run deploy:doctor

   # Deploy to Cloudflare
   bun run deploy
   ```

### Creating Cloudflare Resources Manually

If you prefer not to use the automated `deploy:setup` helper, you can create the resources manually using Cloudflare CLI (Wrangler):

```sh
# Copy configuration template and install dependencies
cp .env.local.example .env.local
bun install

# Create the D1 database
bunx wrangler d1 create edgeever

# Create the R2 bucket
bunx wrangler r2 bucket create edgeever-resources

# Generate the password hash
bun run auth:hash -- <your password>

# Edit .env.local and fill in at least the generated resource and password values
# EDGE_EVER_D1_DATABASE_ID=<database_id returned by the D1 command>
# EDGE_EVER_R2_BUCKET_NAME=edgeever-resources
# EDGE_EVER_AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH=<hash generated above>
# EDGE_EVER_SESSION_TTL_DAYS=400

# Validate the completed configuration before deploying
bun run deploy:doctor
bun run deploy
```

Before running `bun run deploy`, copy the D1 `database_id`, R2 bucket name, and generated password hash into your local `.env.local` file. Keep the session lifetime at the template default of `400` days; the server also caps larger values at 400 days.

`bun run deploy` builds the web app, applies remote D1 migrations, deploys the Worker, and uploads `EDGE_EVER_AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH` as a Worker Secret. After a successful deployment, the script also synchronizes that Secret through `wrangler secret put` to ensure the first login works. Verify the deployment by signing in with `EDGE_EVER_AUTH_USERNAME` and the original password used to generate the hash.

## Enable Automatic Updates

After the first deployment, connect the Worker to your fork with [Cloudflare Workers Builds](cloudflare-workers-builds.md). This is the standard production deployment path for every EdgeEver instance.

After the one-time connection, click **Sync fork** whenever you want upstream updates. The resulting push automatically builds the web app, applies new remote D1 migrations, and deploys the Worker. No GitHub Actions secrets or local redeployment are required.

Keep `bun run deploy` available for first installation and emergency recovery.
